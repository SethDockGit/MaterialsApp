# MaterialsApp


A C# Console Application that functions similar to a bank ATM, allowing the user to check, deposit, and withdraw resources. Implements an interface for data-source classes which allows for toggling between in-memory data as well as persistent data stored through local files. Uses data response objects to carry data and messages across layers, ensuring encapsulation of responsibilities for UI, logic, and data layers. Includes XUnit tests for the InMemory DataSource as well as the Manager class to allow for checking of proper functionality if changes are made to the application.
