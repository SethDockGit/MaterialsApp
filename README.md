# MaterialsApp


A C# Console Application that functions similar to a bank ATM, allowing the user to check, deposit, and withdraw resources. Implements an interface for datasource classes which allows for toggling between in-memory data as well as persistent data stored through local files. Utilizes data response objects to carry data and messages across layers, ensuring encapsulation of responsibilities for UI, logic, and data layers. Includes XUnit tests for the logic and data layers to allow for checking of proper functionality if changes are made to the application.
